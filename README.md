Alright, you want something **in between**: not as long as the first rewrite, but more detailed than the short version. Here's a balanced version:

# Urban Space Planner

**Urban Space Planner** is a web-based platform that helps visualize, analyze, and recommend optimal green spaces for urban areas. Using geospatial data and clustering algorithms, it enables urban planners, researchers, and citizens to make data-driven decisions for sustainable city development.

---

## Features

* **Interactive Mapping** – Visualize localities with color-coded overlays and pollution hotspots.
* **K-Means Clustering** – Identify green-deficient zones through data-driven clustering.
* **Pollution Analytics** – PM2.5-based heatmaps using real urban datasets.
* **Sunlight Analysis** – Assess sunlight exposure to guide future green space planning.
* **Modular Dashboards** – Separate dashboards for mapping, pollution, and sunlight factors.

---

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend Scripts:** Python (data processing & clustering)
* **Visualization:** Leaflet.js, GeoJSON, Matplotlib
* **Data:** CSV datasets of urban locations
