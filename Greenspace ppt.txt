Problem Statement
Urbanization and industrialization are rapidly reshaping our cities, but without thoughtful environmental planning, they pose a serious threat to nature. There is a critical lack of an AI-powered, data-driven system to identify ecological hotspots that need urgent green intervention. Moreover, understanding the types and distribution of existing green spaces is essential to determine the right kind of greenery ‚Äî whether parks, rooftop gardens, or plant types ‚Äî suitable for those areas.

Gap Analysis
GIS-Based Green Space Mapping & Suitability Analysis
Example from Literature:
Many research papers use GIS (Geographic Information Systems) combined with Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to identify suitable areas for green infrastructure based on factors like land use, population density, and accessibility.
Ref: ‚ÄúA GIS-Based Green Space Suitability Analysis‚Äù ‚Äì Urban Forestry & Urban Greening (Journal)
Research Gap:
While these methods are effective in spatial analysis, they lack real-time adaptability, AI integration, and citizen feedback mechanisms.
How Your Solution Covers It:
Your system not only uses clustering to classify zones intelligently but also integrates citizen inputs and AI-based recommendations, making it far more dynamic and actionable.

2. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) via Remote Sensing
Example from Literature:
Studies use satellite imagery and NDVI techniques to detect green cover and its changes over time in urban areas.
Ref: ‚ÄúMonitoring Urban Green Spaces using Remote Sensing‚Äù ‚Äì Journal of Remote Sensing & Environment
Research Gap:
NDVI provides visual and quantitative vegetation data, but it doesn't relate that data to pollution levels, urban usage, or suggestive action (e.g., what kind of plants to grow).
How Your Solution Covers It:
You combine environmental indicators like pollution, transport, and sunlight data with plant recommendation logic, giving actionable insights, not just visual data.

3. Citizen Science Platforms
Example from Literature:
There are some platforms (like iNaturalist or Epicollect) where citizens report biodiversity or environmental issues. Some urban studies have explored citizen involvement in green tracking.
Research Gap:
These platforms lack a structured backend where AI validates, categorizes, and prioritizes areas based on both citizen input and environmental data.
How Your Solution Covers It:
You combine AI-generated red/yellow/green zone tagging with citizen feedback, creating a dual-validation loop for smarter urban green planning

Objectives
üîç Project Objectives
To identify and classify urban zones
‚Üí Use AI-driven clustering (K-Means) on environmental and infrastructural parameters to categorize city regions into Red, Yellow, and Green Zones, indicating urgency of green space development.
To assist city planners with data-driven recommendations
‚Üí Provide actionable suggestions for new green spaces (parks, rooftop gardens, vertical gardens) by analyzing pollution, land use, green cover, and sunlight radiation.
To integrate citizen feedback into planning decisions
‚Üí Enable citizens to report issues (e.g., pollution, water leakage, lack of trees) and provide complimentary data to validate or enrich AI-generated insights.
To analyze existing green space distribution
‚Üí Visualize and evaluate current green areas across city zones to identify gaps and unevenness in accessibility and distribution.
To recommend plant types based on local conditions
‚Üí Leverage sunlight radiation data and zone-specific environmental factors to suggest suitable flora for effective green infrastructure.
To promote environmental sustainability through tech
‚Üí Build a tool that bridges urban development with ecological balance, supporting long-term environmental health in rapidly growing cities

Business Scope

üìà Business Scope
Urban Governance and Smart Cities
Collaborate with municipal bodies, urban planning departments, and Smart City missions to help make data-driven decisions for greener infrastructure.
Integration with existing GIS systems used by local governments to enhance urban planning precision.

Real Estate and Infrastructure Planning
Partner with real estate developers to ensure their projects align with sustainable urban development goals.
Use green zoning insights to market ‚Äúeco-conscious‚Äù residential and commercial spaces.
CSR Initiatives by Corporates
Companies can use the tool to identify high-impact areas for green interventions, like tree plantations or green rooftops, as part of their CSR commitments.
Scalability to Other Cities
Start with Bangalore and expand the model to other metros or Tier-2 cities facing urban heat islands, pollution, and green space scarcity.
SaaS model for different municipalities or private partners.
Integration with Urban Tech Platforms
Offer API or plugin access to urban mobility apps, environmental dashboards, or IoT-based civic monitoring systems.

flow
1. An interactive map to display an analysis of 80 localities within Bangalore classified into 3 zones using caymeans clustering. The classification is based on environmental quality, the parameters such as Greenspace, population density, air quality index, transport access, land use and industries present, so red zone indicates a critical need of more greenery, yellow zone indicates borderline and green indicates good amount of greenery. And clicking on the marker because we get the latitude and longitude 2. Citizen Feedback & Reporting section where in people can write like water leakage or street light on or any evt related and see which authorities to contact and if so how to. AI saying 'This zone needs attention', Citizens confirming it or giving even more specific input. Together it gives city planners a much stronger case for action. suppose i see water leakage or too much pollution i go to drop down that matches my complaint and then we can contact and inform the respective authoritiesthe AI flags a red zone in Indiranagar (high pollution, low green cover) and then citizens also add personal issues No trees on our road or trash cans or smtlike a complimentary or a place where we can actually get the contact of ppl responsidbe for making the change 3. a map which shows the different zones of sunglight radiation received by the city, and based on the radiation it suggest what type of plants or tress can be planted in that particular area 4. So we can select city from the dropdown in the map it shows the existing green space locations and then it recommendations for new green space based on pollution level and park density now tell me what is the problem statement what we are addressjng first
